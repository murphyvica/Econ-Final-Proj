# Econ-Final-Proj

This repo holds all our files for our final project for ECON 481, on the topic "Housing Price Predictions". 

**To run the model and produce our created graphs, run the main.py file**

Additional files we used during code development are placed in the "supporting files" folder, but are not needed to run our models.
